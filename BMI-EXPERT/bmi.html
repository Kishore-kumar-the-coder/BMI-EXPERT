    <h1>What is BMI❔</h1>
    <p class="oo">Body mass index, or BMI, is a way of describing height and weight in one number that can help tell if someone's weight is healthy.</p>
<p>Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of body fat based on height and weight. It doesn’t measure body fat directly, but instead uses an equation to make an approximation. BMI can help determine whether a person is at an unhealthy or healthy weight.

A high BMI can be a sign of too much fat on the body, while a low BMI can be a sign of too little fat on the body. The higher a person’s BMI, the greater their chances of developing certain serious conditions, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. A very low BMI can also cause health problems, including bone loss, decreased immune function, and anemia.

While BMI can be useful in screening children and adults for body weight problems, it does have its limits. BMI may overestimate the amount of body fat in athletes and other people with very muscular bodies. It may also underestimate the amount of body fat in older adults and other people who have lost muscle mass.</p>
<p>For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the 18 to 24 range.

For children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculation takes into account age and gender as well as height and weight.</p>
<p><b>Obesity in adults is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 or above. The other ranges are:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overweight = 25 to 29</li>
  <li>Normal weight = 18 to 24</li>
<li>Underweight = under 18
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Accuracy of BMI</h1>
<p>BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a healthy weight range for a particular height.

As well as measuring your BMI, healthcare professionals may take other factors into account when assessing if you're a healthy weight.

Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy weight even though their BMI is classed as obese.

Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health conditions. For example, adults of Asian origin may have a higher risk of health problems at BMI levels below 25.

You should not use BMI as a measure if you're pregnant. Get advice from your midwife or GP if you're concerned about your weight.</p>

<h1>BMI for Children</h1>
<p>BMI is interpreted differently for people under age 20. While the same formula is used to determine BMI for all age groups, the implications for children and adolescents can vary depending on age and gender. The amount of body fat changes with age. It’s also different in young boys and girls. Girls usually acquire a higher amount of body fat and develop it earlier than boys.

For children and teens, the CDC uses age growth chartsTrusted Source to show BMI as a percentile ranking. Each percentile expresses a child’s BMI relative to other children of the same age and gender. For example, a child would be considered obese if they had a BMI that landed at or above the 95th percentile. This means that they have more body fat than 95 percent of children in the same age and gender category.</p>

<h1>BMI and Health</h1>
<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, more than two in three adults are considered overweight and one in three are considered obese. About 17 percent of children and teenagers (ages 2 to 19) are considered obese.

People gain weight as a result of an energy imbalance. The body needs a certain amount of energy from food in order to function. This energy is obtained in the form of calories. Your weight will usually stay the generally the same when you consume the same number of calories as your body uses or “burns” each day. If you take in more calories than you burn, you will gain weight over time.

Energy imbalance is certainly one of the biggest contributors to weight gain. However, your ideal weight is primarily determined by genetics, as well as by the types of foods you eat and how much you exercise. If you have a high BMI, it’s important to lower it so you’re at a healthy weight status. A high BMI is related to a greater risk of developing serious health conditions</p>

<p>A new study, however, indicates that body fat, not BMI, is more associated with the  health risks. You can lower body fat and get to a healthier weight by exercising at least three times per week. You should also follow certain diet habits, such as eating only when you’re hungry, eating mindfully, and choosing a diet that’s rich in whole, unprocessed foods. You may also benefit from nutritional counseling. A dietitian can teach you which foods to eat and how much food you should eat in order to lose weight.

Just as a high BMI can cause health problems, so can a very low BMI. </p>

<section id="tips">
<p>If you have a low BMI, discuss your weight with your doctor. If needed, increasing the amount of food you eat each day or reducing the amount of exercise can help you gain weight. A dietitian can also help you learn how to gain weight in a healthy way.</p>

<h1 class="h11"><b>Tips:To Gain Weight</b></h1>

<p>1.Eat more frequently. When you're underweight, you may feel full faster. Eat five to six smaller meals during the day rather than two or three large meals.</p>

<p>2.Choose nutrient-rich foods. As part of an overall healthy diet, choose whole-grains; fruits and vegetables; dairy products; lean protein sources; and nuts and seeds.</p>

<p>3.Try smoothies and shakes. Don't fill up on diet soda, coffee and other drinks with few calories and little nutritional value. Instead, drink smoothies or healthy shakes. Drink fluids either before or after a meal. Do not drink with food to avoid becoming full before you eat.</p>

<p>4.Add in calorie-dense snacks. Snack on nuts, peanut butter, low fat cheese, dried fruits and avocados. Have a bedtime snack, such as a peanut butter sandwich, sliced vegetables, oatmeal made with whole milk and lean meat or cheese sandwich.</p>

<p>5.Top it off. Add extras to your dishes for more calories - such as paneer in curries, soups and scrambled eggs, and milk or curd in stews.</p>

<p>6.Have a healthy treat. Even when you're underweight, be mindful of excess sugar and fat. Have healthy treats that also provide nutrients such as fruit flavoured curd topped with dry fruits.</p>

<p>7.Exercise. Exercise, especially strength training, can help you gain weight by building up your muscles. Exercise may also stimulate your appetite.</p>

<p>Consult your doctor or a dietitian for an evaluation. Together, you can plan how to meet your goal weight!</p>
